# Data_manipulation
Code creation to solve daily problems

Data_manipulation_1 is a code I create in order to readapt data that comes from a non-traditional channel and make it useful to use it as input in a macro of traditional channels

Data_manipulation_2 is a code I create with big data (not able to be opened in Excel) in order to clean it, merge it and build some ratios needed.
